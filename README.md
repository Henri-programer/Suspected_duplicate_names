Suppose you have a dataset that records information about a category of people. Some names look similar; for instance, the names nadir moussi, nader moossi, mrs nadir mousi
, and nadir moussie may represent the same person. You wish to group together similar names and send them to the informants or field cordinators to confirm whether or not they
are same people. The python script that we wrote try to address this similarity issue using Levenshtein distance(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) and the theory of Netwoks with connected components.
